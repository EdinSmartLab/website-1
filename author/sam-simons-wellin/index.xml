Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), on the other hand, serves as a popular tool to extract coherent structures from the fluid data and build reduced order models. We present a new method to perform POD on AMR data sets that eliminates repeated operations that arise from using nearest neighbor interpolation of the data onto a uniform grid before performing POD. More fundamentally, we believe that this is the first algorithm to eliminate redundant operations for matrix multiplications with repeated values in each matrix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We provide all code
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tesla-cu/amrPOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a> for &lt;code>amrPOD&lt;/code> to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm as shown in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tesla-cu/amrPOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper&lt;/a>. Specifically, we stress the algorithm using synthetically generated AMR data to identify where the new algorithm out performs standard matrix operations since the new algorithm requires additional overhead of checking the grid level at various locations. Additionally, we show with genuine AMR data of an axisymmetric buoyant jet and a compiled and optimized version of the code, our algorithm reduces the CPU time. Details of how to use the code are provided in the &lt;code>README.md&lt;/code> on

On the computational side, we have developed a simulation testbed in OpenFOAM for the study of temperature, flow fields, and heat transfer processes (i.e., radiation and convection) above the burner and in the burner/roller interaction region. The simulation tool has been used to examine a wide range of conditions, including different roller speeds, burner/roller spacings, burner orientations, and power fluxes. Burners operating in isolation and as part of a larger array have also been studied. Simulations have provided 3D temperature, flow, and heat transfer fields for each of these cases, revealing several useful design heuristics, including the advantage of a down-firing burner configuration, the negative impacts of convective heat transfer on temperature uniformity, and the advantageous effects on uniformity of flow-blocking by the roller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a data-driven technique that uses many low-cost numerical simulations to estimate unknown physical or model parameters (e.g., boundary conditions and material properties), as well as their uncertainties, given reference data from real-world experiments or higher-fidelity numerical simulations. We have used ABC to estimate unknown parameters in simulations of complex thermal-fluid flows, and the technique has been demonstrated for the estimation of unknown boundary conditions in experiments of high temperature burners used for polymer film flame treatments. These tests show that ABC provides accurate and reasonably certain estimates of inflow parameters even when the model simulations imperfectly represent the physics underlying the reference experimental data. We also demonstrate the use of ABC to estimate unknown model parameters in large eddy simulations and Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of turbulent flows. ABC is thus shown to be a versatile technique for estimating unknown physical and model parameters, resulting in substantial improvements in simulation accuracy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
