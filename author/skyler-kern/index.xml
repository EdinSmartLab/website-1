BFM is able to track dissolved organic matter, particulate organic matter, nutrients, dissolved gases, and various phytoplankton and zooplankton groups. The full BFM has 56 state variables and therefore is referred to as BFM56. The model includes a bacteria group, 2 microzooplankton groups, 2 mesozooplankton groups, and 4 phytoplankton groups. In an effort to study the effects of upper ocean turbulence on the biogeochemical processes, we would like to couple BFM with a large-eddy simulation (LES) code. BFM56 is too large to be coupled to a LES model for process studies of small scale ocean dynamics. A lighter model needed to be developed for future work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A reduced model has been produced by simplifying BFM56 to 17 state variables, and is therefore called BFM17. The reduced model has only 1 generic zooplankton group and 1 generic phytoplankton group. BFM17 eliminated the bacteria group by assuming constant remineralization rates between the detritus and nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BFM has been coupled to a one-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM1D). POM1D is used to simulate a column of water through time. It can be run in prognostic mode or diagnostic mode. Prognostic mode simulates all of the dynamics of a water column, while diagnostic mode can be used to force the physics with prescribed temperature and salinity profiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code, available at the git repository linked above, has both BFM56 and BFM17 run options with POM1D. The code has been set up to model phytoplankton bloom dynamics at the Sargasso Sea. POM1D is being run in diagnostic mode using data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series and the Bermuda Testbed Mooring to prescribe temperature, salinity, and boundary conditions. BFM56 and BFM17 have been shown in previous work to produce comparable results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ocean biogeochemistry</title><link>https://teslacu.org/project/ocean_biogeochemistry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/project/ocean_biogeochemistry/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ocean tracers such as carbon dioxide, nutrients, plankton, and oil advect, diffuse, and react primarily in the oceanic mixed layer where air-sea gas exchange occurs and light is plentiful for photosynthesis. There can be substantial heterogeneity in the spatial distributions of these tracers due to turbulent stirring, particularly in the submesoscale range where partly geostrophic fronts and eddies and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence are simultaneously active. We have used LES to understand the respective impacts of small-scale and submesoscale motions on tracer transport. Tracer properties have been characterized using spatial fields and statistics, multiscale fluxes, and spectra, and we detailed how tracer mixing depends on air-sea tracer flux rate, tracer release depth, and flow regime. Although vertical fluxes of buoyancy by submesoscale eddies were shown to compete with mixing by Langmuir turbulence, vertical fluxes of tracers were often dominated by Langmuir turbulence, particularly for tracers released near the mixed-layer base or that dissolve rapidly through the surface, even in regions with pronounced submesoscale activity.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
