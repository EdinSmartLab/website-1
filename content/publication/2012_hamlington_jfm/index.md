abstract: "Local dissipation-scale distributions and high-order statistics of the energy dissipation rate are examined in turbulent channel flow using very high-resolution direct numerical simulations at different Reynolds numbers. For sufficiently large Reynolds number, the dissipation-scale distributions and energy dissipation moments in the channel bulk flow agree with those in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, including only a weak Reynolds-number dependence of both the finest and largest scales. Systematic, but Reynolds number-independent, variations in the distributions and moments arise as the wall is approached. There are substantial differences in the moments between the lowest and the two larger values of Reynolds number. This is most likely caused by coherent vortices from the near-wall region, which fill the whole channel for low Reynolds number."
