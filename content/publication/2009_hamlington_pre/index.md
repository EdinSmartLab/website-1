abstract: "A new fundamentally based formulation of nonlocal effects in the rapid pressure-strain correlation in tur- bulent flows has been obtained. The resulting explicit form for the rapid pressure-strain correlation accounts for nonlocal effects produced by spatial variations in the mean-flow velocity gradients and is derived through Taylor expansion of the mean velocity gradients appearing in the exact integral relation for the rapid pressure-strain correlation. The integrals in the resulting series expansion are solved for high- and low-Reynolds number forms of the longitudinal correlation function, and the resulting nonlocal rapid pressure-strain correlation is expressed as an infinite series in terms of Laplacians of the mean strain rate tensor. This formulation is used to obtain a nonlocal transport equation for the turbulence anisotropy that is expected to provide improved predictions of the anisotropy in strongly inhomogeneous flows."
