abstract: "Turbulent combustion is a multi-scale and multi-physics problem depending upon both chemical and fluid dynamic processes. These processes are often examined using an Eule- rian framework, but recently the Lagrangian framework, a long-time tool in non-reacting flow research, has become increasingly common for the study of turbulent combustion. The two analysis frameworks are in fact equivalent, with the only difference being a change in reference frame. In this study, a Lagrangian fluid parcel tracking algorithm is developed and validated, with the ultimate goal of analyzing enstrophy (i.e., vorticity magnitude) dynamics in premixed reacting flows. The algorithm and its subroutines are applied to two-dimensional analytic flows, forced and decaying three-dimensional non-reacting homo- geneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and a three-dimensional premixed reacting flow in an unconfined domain. The analysis of vorticity dynamics in the premixed flame case is based on data from three dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a premixed hydrogen-air flame in a doubly periodic box. Vorticity budget terms are tracked along Lagrangian trajectories as fluid parcels travel through the flame, with particular focus on understanding the evolution of turbulence through the flame preheat and reaction zones."
