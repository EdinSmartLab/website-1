The dynamic mesh adaptation is used to improve the accuracy. The mesh adaptation method in use is built on the base of nodes-redistribution techniques. Its implementation implies the solution of additional differential equation governing the mesh movement. The method allows to keep a topology of the initial mesh and does not increase significantly the computational costs. The technology is developed for 2D formulations and verified on model problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Systems engineering and optimization of wind turbines and power plants</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/systems-engineering-and-optimization-of-wind-turbines-and-power-plants/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/systems-engineering-and-optimization-of-wind-turbines-and-power-plants/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Temporal coherence importance sampling for wind turbine extreme loads estimation</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/temporal-coherence-importance-sampling-for-wind-turbine-extreme-loads-estimation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/temporal-coherence-importance-sampling-for-wind-turbine-extreme-loads-estimation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Flow dynamics in a variable-spacing, three bluff-body flowfield</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/flow-dynamics-in-a-variable-spacing-three-bluff-body-flowfield/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/flow-dynamics-in-a-variable-spacing-three-bluff-body-flowfield/</guid><description>&lt;p>This work explores the wake dynamics of systems with three bluff bodies with variable spacing. Studies of single-wake systems have shown that coherent wake vortices have a regular and predictable periodicity. A growing literature of dual-wake studies has shown that multi-wake systems are more stochastic than single-wake systems, and their dynamics are highly dependent on the spacing between the wakes. Here, we expand on this literature by investigating three-wake systems and find that the coherent dynamics of the wakes are highly intermittent. We use proper orthogonal decomposition to extract the most energetic modes of the three-wake system at six bluff-body spacings that span a range of dynamical “regimes.” After describing the time-dependent behavior of the interacting wakes in these regimes, we use a statistical approach to describe the relative phase between oscillations in each of the wakes, identifying regimes where oscillations are more or less random. Interestingly, the wake oscillations are less random when the bluff bodies are positioned very close and relatively far from each other. In between these two extremes, an intermediary regime is identified where the wake oscillations are almost completely random; this finding parallels data from the dual-wake literature. Finally, we discuss the implications of the observed behaviors and possible future directions for this work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Active subspaces for wind plant surrogate modeling</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/active-subspaces-for-wind-plant-surrogate-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/active-subspaces-for-wind-plant-surrogate-modeling/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Assessment of wind parameter sensitivity on ultimate and fatigue wind turbine loads</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/assessment-of-wind-parameter-sensitivity-on-ultimate-and-fatigue-wind-turbine-loads/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/assessment-of-wind-parameter-sensitivity-on-ultimate-and-fatigue-wind-turbine-loads/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Exploring Optimization Opportunities in Four-Point Suspension Wind Turbine Drivetrains through Integrated Design Approaches</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/exploring-optimization-opportunities-in-four-point-suspension-wind-turbine-drivetrains-through-integrated-design-approaches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/exploring-optimization-opportunities-in-four-point-suspension-wind-turbine-drivetrains-through-integrated-design-approaches/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wind Turbine Optimization with WISDEM</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-turbine-optimization-with-wisdem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-turbine-optimization-with-wisdem/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Optimization Under Uncertainty for Wake Steering Strategies</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-for-wake-steering-strategies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-for-wake-steering-strategies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Numerical study of acoustic radiation dynamics of a Rankine vortex</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-study-of-acoustic-radiation-dynamics-of-a-rankine-vortex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-study-of-acoustic-radiation-dynamics-of-a-rankine-vortex/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper investigates a problem of sound radiation by a perturbed Rankine vortex, which is important for understanding the nature of vortex flows. We present numerical simulation results for quadrupole and higher mode radiations and consider the structure and dynamics of tonal acoustic radiation generated by a vortex in detail. We also describe the transition of a Rankine vortex to a perturbed state under small external perturbation. Numerical simulations are performed using the EBR (Edge-based reconstruction) scheme implemented in NOISEtte.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Optimization under uncertainty of site-specific turbine configurations</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-of-site-specific-turbine-configurations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-of-site-specific-turbine-configurations/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wind farm turbine type and placement optimization</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-farm-turbine-type-and-placement-optimization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-farm-turbine-type-and-placement-optimization/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Effect of Flame Spacing and Flow Velocity on the Dynamics of Three Interacting V-Flames</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/effect-of-flame-spacing-and-flow-velocity-on-the-dynamics-of-three-interacting-v-flames/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/effect-of-flame-spacing-and-flow-velocity-on-the-dynamics-of-three-interacting-v-flames/</guid><description>&lt;p>Flame interaction is a phenomenon that occurs in a number of combustion devices and can change both the time-averaged shape and dynamical behavior of flames. In this study, we investigate the impact of flame spacing and bulk flow velocity on the time averaged characteristics of three, two-dimensional, bluff-body stabilized V-flames. Velocity fields and flame edges are extracted from particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to quantify the differences in behavior of these flames at three flame spacings and two bulk flow velocities with Reynolds numbers of 4000 and 8000 based on bluff-body diameter. Higher bulk flow velocities cause the flame intersection point to move downstream. Increasing the bluff-body spacing also moves the intersection point farther
downstream. Reducing bluff-body spacing causes the recirculation zone behind the bluff bodies to significantly diminish and reduces flame brush growth. Discussion of the impact of these geometric and flow parameters is discussed and plans for future work are provided.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerical simulation of acoustic waves scattering by isolated vortex structures</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-simulation-of-acoustic-waves-scattering-by-isolated-vortex-structures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-simulation-of-acoustic-waves-scattering-by-isolated-vortex-structures/</guid><description>&lt;p>The problem of sound scattering by an isolated vortex is not only interesting by itself but also is fundamental for understanding the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex flow, including the process of sound generation by turbulence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When turbulence is represented by a distribution of localized vortices with certain static properties, the acoustic field scattered by such flow is a superposition of scattered acoustic fields from each vortex. Therefore, the description of an elementary event, scattering of sound by an isolated vortex, can be used to predict the impact on the acoustic field of the turbulent flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the numerical simulation of this problem, we use a linear approximation of the mathematical model. This approximation is quite realistic because it reveals the main properties of the studied phenomena. Thus we model the problem using a system of linearized Euler equations, in which a vortex is defined as a background field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use EBR (Edge-Based Reconstruction) numerical scheme, the 5th order scheme based on the quasi-one-dimensional reconstruction, implemented in highly parallel research code NOISEtte (KIAM RAS). One of the goals of this study is to test the EBR scheme&amp;rsquo;s ability to model such problems on unstructured grids and to assess its accuracy and efficiency compared to other approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we show the simulation results of the plane acoustic wave scattering by isentropic Gaussian-core vortex with a constant circulation velocity and demonstrate the grid convergence to the benchmark solution. Besides Cartesian meshes, we also use quasi-uniform unstructured triangular meshes and demonstrate that the results are almost identical for the same number of mesh points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also consider the problem of the cylindrical point source acoustic wave scattering by the Rankine vortex. We perform simulations on unstructured meshes and compare the results of different numerical approaches: a finite-volume approach (NOISEtte EBR), a finite element approach (Actran DGM), and a finite-difference (Cabaret scheme).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results confirm that NOISEtte and this numerical method can be successfully used to simulate the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex structures.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
